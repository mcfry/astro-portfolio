This application was built to fast track the ability to memorize a deck of cards using the PAO mnemonic system.

It includes:
- A default mnemonic system to get you started.
- An interactive 3D panorama to serve as your memory palace that you can place cards in.
- An interactive card maker that allows you to upload images and move them around.
- The ability to create your own mnemonic system.
- The ability to create your own 3D memory palaces from images that you upload.
- A flash card testing and scoring system for you to practice and keep track of your best times.

I developed the app with a clear purpose: to enhance my card memorization skill and create a more efficient learning process. It seemed like a really cool idea when I started. Unfortunately, at some point I realized that I would rather just use a real deck of cards, lol. That said, the app is fully functional and has some nifty features (like placing interactive hotspots in an image that you can upload). If I had time I could really dive further into placing 'hotspots' in a 3D space and elevate the learning experience.

Built with: Rails (api), PostgreSQL, Devise (users), React, MobX, Three.js (panorama), and Bootstrap
